					<p>
						Aerial Yoga is a fusion technique class that will challenge your strength, flexibility and endurance.
					</p>
					<p>
						It utilises aspects of traditional yoga, Pilates, calisthenics, dance, and gymnastics. Aerial Yoga is designed to increase one’s overall health and physical agility while having fun and creating beauty. Learn to flip, invert, fly while getting the best workout.
					</p>
					<p>
						Aerial Yoga improves flexibility, balance and blood flow. It also decompresses your spine and joints making you more mobile. It strengthens supporting muscles making it a great workout for injury prevention. It’s also particularly beneficial if you suffer from back pain, as it stretches out the vertebrae.

					<h3 class="pink">Aerial Pilates</h3>
					<p>
						Aerial Pilates is a body conditioning routine that helps build flexibility and long, lean muscles, strength and endurance in the legs, abdominals, arms, hips, and back. It puts emphasis on spinal and pelvic alignment, breathing to relieve stress and allow adequate oxygen flow to muscles, developing a strong core or centre (tones abdominals while strengthening the back), and improving coordination and balance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pilates' flexible system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginner to advanced. Intensity can be increased over time as the body conditions and adapts to the exercises.
						No muscle group is under or over trained. It enhances core strength and brings increased reach, flexibility, sure-footedness and agility.

					<p>
						A ground-based, mat work class that blends Yoga, Tai Chi and Pilates. A beautiful flowing workout set to music with carefully structured series of moves, poses and stretches. A typical class starts with a Tai-Chi warm-up followed by the traditional Yoga Sun Salutations. We then move into a standing section to strengthen the legs and then find balance.

						The journey continues to move through the body as the focus turns to gaining greater flexibility in the hips, hamstrings and back. And of course…there is core work! This class is great for those wanting to improve strength and flexibility.
