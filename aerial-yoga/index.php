					<p>
						AntiGravity&reg; Yoga is a fusion technique class that will challenge your strength, flexibility and 
						endurance. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It utilizes aspects of traditional yoga, Pilates, calisthenics, dance, and gymnastics. 
						AntiGravity&reg; Yoga is designed to increase one’s overall health and physical agility while having fun and 
						creating beauty. Learn to flip, invert, fly while getting the best workout.
					</p>
					<p>
						AntiGravity&reg; Yoga improves flexibility, balance and blood flow. It also decompresses your spine and 
						joints making you more mobile. It strengthens supporting muscles making it a great workout for injury 
						prevention. It’s also particularly beneficial if you suffer from back pain, as it stretches out the 
						vertebrae.

					<h3 class="pink">AntiGravity Pilates - All levels and suitable for the absolute beginner</h3>
					<p>
						Pilates is a body conditioning routine that helps build flexibility and long, lean muscles, strength and 
						endurance in the legs, abdominals, arms, hips, and back. It puts emphasis on spinal and pelvic 
						alignment, breathing to relieve stress and allow adequate oxygen flow to muscles, developing a 
						strong core or centre (tones abdominals while strengthening the back), and improving coordination 
						and balance. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Pilates' flexible system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty 
						from beginner to advanced. Intensity can be increased over time as the body conditions and adapts to 
						the exercises.
					</p>
					<p>
						No muscle group is under or over trained. It enhances core strength and brings 
						increased reach, flexibility, sure-footedness and agility.

					<p>
						Restore and renew your mind, body and spirit in the AntiGravity hammock. AntiGravity Yoga SloFlow 
						is for those who love the benefits of zero-compression inversions and are interested in an AGY 
						modality that is more yogic and less fitness oriented.
					</p>
					<p>
						This suspended yoga class incorporates levitating meditations, zero-compression inversions, supported sun salutations, isometric style 
						muscular contractions, flexibility and balance conditioning, and a floating Savasana. The utilization of 
						upside down poses help release the stress.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let yourself completely relax in the inverted poses, at 
						complete peace dangling upside down in the hammock.
