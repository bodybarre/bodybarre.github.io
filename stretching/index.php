					<p>
						Let us unlock the stretching secrets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stiff as a board? Supple as a slinky cat? You can be either to join this class! You are never to old to pop yourself into the splits pose. For some it comes naturally and for others it takes time - but it does arrive - eventually - with hard work and commitment to the course, splits will be yours! And if you’ve already got splits - maintain them - or start to work over splits - we will always keep you challenged to work the best version of you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Options to cater to each individual, we can make things more challenging and easier for you. Let's smash some bendy goals! Make sure you wear some comfy warm clothes for this class, and make sure you can move easily in your chosen outfit!
