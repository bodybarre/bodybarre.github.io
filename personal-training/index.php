						Want to get bendy?<br/>
						Realign your body?<br/>
						Got flexibility goals?<br/>
						Stay finely tuned?<br/>
						Monthly 'MOT'?!<br/>
						Then PSP is for you!

				</p>

					Our stretch specialist will design a personalised programme to suit your goals. We have lots of equipment you can use at the studio to help you reach your best flex. After your initial assessment you can take away your set training programme to practice at home or at the studio. Re-book for an assessment 6 - 12 weeks later - everybody is different, once it starts to feel easy you are ready to refresh your programme.

We will design you a 60 minute programme to get you on the right track. Pick your wish and we will get the magic in action with some spell binding exercises! Check back in with your instructor after 6 - 12 weeks for a new plan. Everybody is different, once it starts to feel easy you are ready for new challenges... remember, you can only change the body if your challenge it.

						Want extra help?<br/>

						Then personal training is for you!
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Sometimes it is nice to receive personal coaching away from the group exercise atmosphere. We can pop the spotlight just on you and check out your skills in more detail. In a private lesson we can work towards your desired goals and find methods that will help improve your skills. Whether you are finding yourself stuck in a rut or want to learn a new skill, or simply want to improve your training knowledge - private tuition will deliver success!
