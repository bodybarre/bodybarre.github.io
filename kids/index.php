					<p>
						Kids Aerial Circus classes are a great way for kids to get fit, meet new people and learn an interesting range of skills. Our classes are well-structured, with a clear progression throughout each term, we teach the kids how to become budding circus stars in a safe and fun environment.

						The weekly sessions target a number of different skills throughout the term. We use specialised Circus apparatus including Aerial Silks, Static Trapeze, Aerial Hoop and Aerial Hammock.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fun circus apparatus which makes exercise more active and exciting. No prior experience is required to join the fun.
