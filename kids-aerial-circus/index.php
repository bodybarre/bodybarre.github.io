					<p>
						Kids Aerial Circus classes are a great way for kids to get fit, meet new people and 
						learn an interesting range of skills. Our classes are well-structured, with a clear 
						progression throughout each term, we teach the kids how to become budding circus 
						stars in a safe and fun environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						The weekly sessions target a number of 
						different skills throughout the term. We use specialized equipment including a 
						matted floor area, gymnastic crash mats, training bar, and a floor balance beam as 
						well as Circus apparatus including Vertical Pole, Silks, Static Trapeze and Aerial Hoop.
					</p>
					<p>
						Safety based and technique driven class instruction covers everything from fitness to 
						performance. We combine the core elements of basic gymnastic skills with fun circus 
						apparatus to make exercise more active and exciting. No prior experience is required 
						to join the fun. Children are encouraged to strive for, and reach individual goals,
						paced to their own ability, all within a non-competitive environment.
