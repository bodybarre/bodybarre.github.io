				<p>
					Bodybarre started out as the first Pole Fitness School in Manchester and have grown to offer so much
					more! We pride ourselves on being one of the most extraordinary Boutique Fitness Studios in
					Manchester!
				</p>
				<p>
					Our friendly expert teachers deliver high quality individually tailored tuition. We offer classes
					and courses over a flexible schedule allowing us to fit into your way of life. All Bodybarre
					instructors are committed to provide the best fitness experience available. Every session is
					informative and energising and has been beautifully crafted by top industry fitness professionals
					who are talented and inspiring.
				</p>
				<p>
					The mixture of fitness and dance performance are combined to create classes like you have never
					experienced before. The classes focus on those attending and are designed to suit, so that you can
					achieve the fitness results you are looking for. We also feel it is essential that all classes are
					enjoyable as this ensures participation remains focused and both eyes stay firmly fixed on the
					instructor rather than with one eye on the clock.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bodybarre classes are empowering, energising and carried out within a safe, friendly and informal
					environment.
