				<p>
					Hula Hoop yourself slim.
				</p>
				<p>
					What’s not to love about this super-fun workout? It burns mega calories, sculpts your body, and blasts off belly fat. You can burn as many calories in a 30 minute hula hoop class as you can in a spin exercise bike class – that’s 150 to 250 calories per workout!
				</p>
				<p>
					You can’t match the appeal of the massaging rolls! Come and head-to-toe tone up and lose inches all over your body. Yep, belly included!

					This has to be one of the coolest classes on the timetable? The Skateboard workout is an exercise program developed to tone up the body. The main focus of this class is to strengthen the core, but your lower and upper body and going to get blitzed too.

					A full body workout that you will feel working! Here at Bodybarre we like to keep you challenged, using a skateboard really ups the intensity of a workout.
